# Football Points System

This is a Python program that calculates and identifies the winner(s) of a football league based on user-entered match results for 13 teams. Each team earns points from wins and draws, and the program determines which team(s) scored the highest.

## Features

- Input validation to ensure data accuracy
- Dynamic calculation of team points based on results
- Handles multiple winners in the case of a tie
- Simple text-based interface

## Why I Built This

I developed this project while learning the basics of Python, including loops, conditionals, list structures, and user input. It was based on an O-Level pseudocode-style problem and helped me strengthen my understanding of program logic and error handling in real-world scenarios.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your machine.
2. Save the script as `football_points_system.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
5. Run the program using:
      ```bash
   python football_points_system.py

   ```bash
   python football_points_system.py
